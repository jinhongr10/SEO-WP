# WordPress Media SEO Optimizer (Safe In-Place Overwrite)

This project now includes a production-oriented CLI + minimal dashboard to SEO-optimize and compress existing WordPress/WooCommerce media images **without changing attachment ID, URL, filename, extension, or uploads relative path**.

A new UI tab `媒体库SEO压缩` has also been added to the app (`App.tsx`) as an operational entry panel.

## Guarantees

- Keeps attachment ID unchanged.
- Keeps `source_url` unchanged.
- Keeps filename unchanged.
- Keeps file extension unchanged.
- Overwrites at exact path under `wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/filename.ext`.
- Stores local backup before overwrite for rollback.
- Supports dry-run, pagination, concurrency limits, retries, and resume by SQLite state.

## Implemented Structure

- `src/wp.ts` - WordPress REST client (scan, metadata update, download)
- `src/sftp.ts` - SFTP backup/overwrite/verification
- `src/optimize.ts` - same-extension image compression with `sharp`
- `src/seo.ts` - pluggable SEO generator (deterministic stub enabled)
- `src/db.ts` - SQLite state/cache/snapshots/runs
- `src/cli.ts` - commands: `scan`, `run`, `rollback`, `report`, `dashboard`

## Blog Pre-Publish Optimizer

The blog workspace now includes a publish-prep panel for human-edited drafts:

- Upload a business-edited final file (`.docx`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.html`) and optimize it immediately.
- Load WordPress draft posts into the editor.
- Convert Markdown/plain drafts into Gutenberg-friendly HTML blocks.
- Add heading anchors, a table of contents, CTA copy, and related internal links.
- Rank internal links from published pages/posts plus the local WooCommerce product cache.
- Preview the optimized HTML before syncing.
- Sync back as a draft or publish after confirmation, including AIOSEO title/description when the LensCraft AIOSEO endpoint is available.

Relevant backend endpoints:

- `POST /blog/import-file`
- `GET /blog/drafts`
- `GET /blog/posts/{post_id}`
- `POST /blog/optimize`
- `POST /blog/apply`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Access to WordPress REST API
- WordPress Application Password (recommended default auth)
- SFTP access to WordPress host (Cloudways-compatible)

If Cloudflare challenges WordPress REST requests and this app runs from a Mac or other dynamic IP, avoid IP allowlists. Configure a private REST bypass header instead:

1. Generate a long random secret and set it in Settings:
   - `Cloudflare REST Header Name`: `X-LensCraft-REST-Token`
   - `Cloudflare REST Header Value`: your random secret
2. In Cloudflare, create a WAF custom rule with a Skip action for requests matching:
   - path starts with `/wp-json/`
   - header `x-lenscraft-rest-token` equals the same secret
3. Skip the features that are issuing the challenge, typically Managed Rules, Super Bot Fight Mode, Browser Integrity Check, Security Level, and rate limiting.

The backend only attaches this header to the configured WordPress host and `/wp-json/` paths, so the secret is not sent to arbitrary URLs. For media binary replacement, SFTP remains the safest primary path when Cloudflare or host-level bot protection blocks custom REST uploads.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

For desktop/customer builds, open the app settings panel and fill the module
credentials there. The backend saves runtime settings outside the project
directory, using the OS user data directory by default:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%/SeoWpSync/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/SeoWpSync/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/SeoWpSync/`

Do not ship real `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.server`, `keys/`, SQLite databases,
cache folders, backups, or local `settings.json` in a release package.

Development and server deployments may still use environment variables. Required
key settings:

- `WP_BASE_URL`
- `WP_USER`
- `WP_APP_PASSWORD` (or `WP_JWT`)
- `WP_REST_BYPASS_HEADER_NAME` / `WP_REST_BYPASS_HEADER_VALUE` (optional Cloudflare REST bypass)
- `SFTP_HOST`
- `SFTP_USER`
- `REMOTE_WP_ROOT`
- `UPLOADS_RELATIVE` (default: `wp-content/uploads`)

## Commands

```bash
# 1) Scan media library into local SQLite state
npm run media:scan

# 2) Execute pipeline (recommended to run dry-run first)
npm run media:run -- --dry-run true
npm run media:run -- --dry-run false

# 3) Rollback specific media IDs
npm run media:rollback -- --ids 123,456

# 4) Report
npm run media:report

# 5) Minimal local dashboard
npm run media:dashboard
# open http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Filter examples:

```bash
npm run media:run -- --mime webp --min-size-kb 120 --limit 500
npm run media:run -- --ids 101,202,303
npm run media:run -- --since 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

## Cloudways + WP Application Password Setup

1. In WordPress Admin, create an Application Password for a user with media edit permissions.
2. Set `.env`:
   - `WP_BASE_URL=https://your-site.com`
   - `WP_USER=your_wp_user`
   - `WP_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`
3. In Cloudways panel, confirm SFTP credentials and application path.
4. Set:
   - `REMOTE_WP_ROOT=/home/master/applications/<app_id>/public_html`
   - `UPLOADS_RELATIVE=wp-content/uploads`
5. Run dry-run first:
   - `npm run media:run -- --dry-run true`
6. Verify report and then run real overwrite:
   - `npm run media:run -- --dry-run false`
7. Purge caches after completed run:
   - WP Rocket
   - Cloudways Varnish
   - Cloudflare (if enabled)

If you still want to try `--use-rest-replace`, add a Cloudflare bypass rule for `/wp-json/lenscraft/v1/media/*` from your runner IP. Otherwise the CLI now falls back to SFTP automatically when both transports are configured.

## Safety and Rollback

- Every overwrite first downloads remote original file to `backup/remote/{mediaId}/filename.ext`.
- Previous metadata is snapshot-saved in SQLite.
- `rollback` uploads backup to original remote path and restores old metadata.

## Acceptance Checklist

- WooCommerce product image still displays after run.
- Attachment ID unchanged.
- `source_url` unchanged.
- Majority of images are smaller where optimization is possible.
- SEO fields in Media Library are updated.
